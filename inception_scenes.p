S"FADE IN:  DAWN. CRASHING SURF.  The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand. He lies there.  A CHILD'S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat a SANDCASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. The Bearded Man tries to call them, but they RUN OFF, FACES UNSEEN. He COLLAPSES.  The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back. A JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up the beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind them is a cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE.  "

S" The speaker, COBB, is 35, handsome, tailored. A young Japanese man, SAITO, eats as he listens.  Cobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass-  Saito's fork pauses, mid-air. Cobb GRINS. A third man is at the table- ARTHUR. He jumps in to save the pitch-  Saito looks at Cobb, curious.  Cobb leans forwards. Holding Saito's gaze.  Saito gives this a flicker of a smile. Rises. A BODYGUARD opens double doors which give onto a LAVISH PARTY.  They watch Saito leave. Arthur turns to Cobb, worried-  Cobb motions silence. A TREMOR starts, they steady their glasses, Cobb glances at his watch- THE SECOND HAND IS FROZEN.  And we-   FILTHY BATHROOM - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME)  Cobb, ASLEEP, SITTING IN A CHAIR AT THE END OF A STEAMING BATH. The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legs level with the rim of the tub.  A sweating man (40's) watches over Cobb. This is NASH. A distant EXPLOSION rumbles through the room. Nash moves to the window, parts the curtains. Outside: a CHAOTIC DEVELOPING-WORLD CITY- the street filled with RIOTERS- SMASHING, BURNING.  Nash checks Cobb's left wrist: above his watch, tape holds TWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place. Nash looks at Cobb's watch- THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY.  Nash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Arthur's feet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair. Tubes connect the briefcase to Arthur's wrist.  Nash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where they pass under the door to the bedroom. Through the crack of the door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running to his wrist.

S" A LOW TREMOR RUMBLES THROUGH THE CASTLE. Cobb and Arthur steady themselves against the wooden rail. Several TILES and pieces of MASONRY fall. Below them a BLACK SEA churns. Other GUESTS wander the massive terraces.  Arthur nods. Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulder.  Cobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed, staring out at the sea. This is MAL. Cobb watches her.  Arthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head. She nears Cobb. Looks out at the DROP. The WIND WHIPS HER HAIR-  She turns to look at him. Amused.  She smiles. He leans in, mesmerized.  She stares up at him, inviting.  "

S" Mal sips champagne as she studies a painting by Francis Bacon.  Cobb is looking down through the window at the GUARDS patrolling the castle at ground level.  He turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gloves.  Mal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wingback chair. Cobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE and kneels at Mal's feet. She looks down at him.  Cobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS.  Cobb pauses. He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal's ankle. He looks up at her.  Mal looks away, uncomfortable. Cobb gets to his feet, letting out the rope as he moves back to the window.  Cobb tosses the rope out-  He tugs on the rope, testing. The weight of the chair, with Mal on it, holds.  And with that, he JUMPS. Mal considers the open window.  "

Cobb slowly places his gun at his end of the long table, then SLIDES it along the polished ebony. It comes to rest HALFWAY down the length or the table.  Cobb reaches into his waistband, removes ONE of the envelopes, SLIDES it along the table. Steps back, hands raised.  Arthur gives Cobb an I-told-you-so look.  Mal COCKS the gun at Arthur's temple.

S" Nash' eyes open, AWAKE.  Nash BLINKS. Arthur is in his face, furious.  Cobb pulls Arthur away from Nash.  Arthur moves to the briefcase. Turns a dial.  Arthur hits a button- A PLUNGER DEPRESSES. Cobb RIPS the tape off Saito's wrist, ROLLS up his tubes. Arthur SLAMS the silver case shut. Todashi pulls open the door-  Arthur and Nash EXIT, heading in different directions down the corridor. Cobb hands Todashi a thick roll of CASH, looks at Saito, who stirs. Cobb moves off.  "

INSERT CUT: A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL (5), also FACE UNSEEN, joins JAMES, CROUCHING BESIDE HIM...  Cobb TENSES, as if about to SMASH the phone.  Cobb looks like he just got punched- INSERT CUT: COBB'S MEMORY- MAL, WIND BLOWING HER HAIR, SMILES CALMLY...  Cobb STARES at the dead phone. Then DOWNS his drink- A KNOCK at the door.

S" Miles and Cobb stand by as STUDENTS file out of a lecture.  A young woman carrying books turns. This is ARIADNE.  She sizes him up with quick eyes. Offers her hand.  Ariadne raises her eyebrows.  Ariadne takes the pad and pen. Cobb looks at his watch.  She starts DRAWING LINES on the grid, constructing a maze.  Ariadne hands the pad and pen to Cobb. He glances at the pad, then, looking her in the eye, TRACES the solution. She is taken aback. Cobb RIPS off the sheet, hands the pad back.  She traces straight lines, CONCENTRATING...  She hands Cobb the pad, a touch pleased. Cobb solves the puzzle instantly, as before. Her smile falls.  She GRABS the pad, frustrated... but this time she FLIPS it over and starts drawing on the BLANK CARDBOARD of the back. Cobb watches, surprised. He smiles as he sees that she's drawing CIRCLES, creating a maze based on concentric rings.  Ariadne hands back the pad, defiant. Cobb takes the pen, starts the maze. This time he gets stuck. Nods.

S" Ariadne walks down the crowded street with Cobb. Cobb looks around at the street, the cafe, approving.  Ariadne looks at the passers-by.  Ariadne wonders at the detail of the street.  She CONCENTRATES on the street. The street starts to BEND IN HALF- the buildings on either side FOLDING IN until they form the INSIDE OF A CUBE OF CITY, GRAVITY FUNCTIONING INDEPENDENTLY ON EACH PLANE. Ariadne looks up (or down) at the people on the opposite city surface. Cobb watches her excitement.  As they walk, Ariadne notices more and more of the projections STARING at her.  They walk along the street to where it joins the next gravitational plane. They step up onto the different plane and walk down the street towards a river. As Ariadne approaches, steps emerge from the flagstone, and she leads Cobb up onto a small jetty. As she concentrates, pillars emerge and a BRIDGE starts to telescope out from the jetty. They step onto it as it grows. Cobb is impressed.  People crossing the bridge STARE at Ariadne. Several of them BUMP her shoulder as they pass.  The bridge now spans the Seine. Cobb marvels at it.  Cobb pauses, thinking. Remembering.  INSERT CUT: Mal, hair blowing, turns to Cobb, smiling, laughing. He smiles back. They are on the same bridge.  Several people around them ECHO Cobb's attitude...  Cobb says nothing. He stands there, starinq at Ariadne. PEOPLE around her stop and look at her, hostile.  Cobb reaches for Ariadne's arm, turns her to him-  A passerby GRABS Ariadne's shoulder-  More of the crowd join in, PULLING at Ariadne, holding her arms open- Cobb PULLS people off- the crowd PUSHES him away- Cobb sees someone WALKING PURPOSEFULLY through the crowd towards the helpless, Ariadne- it is Mal. She approaches with even strides- Ariadne stares at her, uneasy.  As Mal walks, she pulls out a LARGE KNIFE-  Ariadne SCREAMS as Mal LUNGES at her with the knife and we-   "

Cobb HEAD BUTTS the Second Businessman, PUSHES past him-  The First Businessman races out of the bar, sees Cobb's wake, DIVES after him- Cobb RACES headlong through tight passageways, WEAVING through or KNOCKING into the locals...  He steps into a dark, crowded cafe, scanning the tables... the First Businessman enters, spots him. An AFRICAN MAN gets in Cobb's face, jabbering at him in Swahili- Cobb considers his options... the First Businessman DRAWS A GUN- Cobb bolts, steps up on a table and out an open window, SCRAMBLING into the alley outside...  Cobb LOOKS left, right... CUTS LEFT into a narrow, CROWDED alley- the alley NARROWS TO A DEAD END. Faces in the CROWD start to watch Cobb- PEOPLE start to SURROUND him- Cobb looks back the way he came- the two Businessmen are there, GUNS DRAWN-  Cobb sees a SMALL GAP between the buildings at the narrow end- he THROWS himself into it- gets STUCK HALFWAY...  The crowd bears down, GRABBING for him as Cobb struggles to SQUEEZE HIMSELF through the gap... Cobb's moving INCHES as his pursuers gain YARDS... the Crowd is upon him... he BURSTS FREE. TUMBLING onto the next street, ROLLING out of sight.  Cobb Jumps to his feet- in a market square. TWO MORE BUSINESSMEN move towards him. Cobb BOLTS but a CAR SKIDS UP, BLOCKS HIS PATH- the door opens- SAITO IS IN THE BACK.  "

S" Row upon row of wooden shelves holding hundreds of dusty glass bottles of all shapes and colors. At the far end, a portly 40-year-old man rises from behind his desk, beckoning. This is YUSUF.  Eames shakes Yusuf's hand. Yusuf stops at Cobb.  Yusuf chases a CAT off Saito's chair.  Yusuf moves to a shelf and runs his fingers over the glass bottles. None of them has a label.  Yusuf places a bottle on the desk in front of Cobb.  Yusuf pulls the stopper, holds it towards Cobb's nose.  Yusuf WHIPS the bottle away from Cobb, offended.  Yusuf holds the bottle to the light, marveling.  Yusuf puts the bottle back onto the shelf. Sits.  Cobb looks at him, uneasy. Yusuf pulls out another bottle.  Yusuf hands it to Cobb, who considers the white liquid inside.  Yusuf beckons them further into the pharmacy, to a METAL DOOR. He STOPS- second thoughts.  Cobb motions to continue. Yusuf pulls out a large key.  "

S" A dark room with ROWS of low COTS. Each with a sleeping occupant. Tubes connect their wrists. An ELDERLY BALD MAN watches over them.  Yusuf nods at the Elderly Bald Man, who moves to the nearest bed. Reaches out to the OCCUPANT. Gives his face a FIRM SLAP. The sleeper does not even stir.  Saito surveys the room, appalled.  Cobb STARES at the sleepers. Uneasy.  Cobb turns to the Elderly Bald Man, who looks fondly at his dreamers.  The Elderly Bald Man pokes a crooked finger at Cobb's chest.  Cobb STARES at the Elderly Bald Man. DISTURBED. Cobb turns to Yusuf. TOSSES him the bottle.  "

Motions silence, as he glances at his FATHER in the bed. Wheezing gently.  MAURICE LASHES OUT, KNOCKING things from his bedside table. A NURSE calms Maurice as Fischer crouches to retrieve a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH. He looks at the photo through the broken glass- a YOUNG BOY holds a PINWHEEL CLEARLY MADE BY A CHILD (each of the points is numbered in pen), his FATHER blows on it.  Browning looks at Fischer, considering. Biding his time.  Eames WATCHES Browning, STUDYING his every move .  "

Ariadne follows his gaze to the garden. A small blonde boy faces away from them, crouched on his haunches to look at something on the ground.  A slightly older girl RUNS into view.

S" The luxurious cabin has only ten seats. Cobb finds his- sees Ariadne in the seat behind his. They do not acknowledge each other. Behind her is Arthur, looking out the window. Eames enters, STUFFS his bag into the overhead bin, BLOCKING the passenger behind: ROBERT FISCHER, standing there, patient, bag in hand, wearing black.  Eames SQUEEZES up against his seat to let Fischer BRUSH PAST. Fischer moves to his seat, directly in front of Cobb. Eames TOSSES Cobb a PASSPORT. Cobb flips it open: Fischer's. Pockets it. Yusuf and Saito enter, take their seats.  "

S" Cobb looks down at his hand: a TINY VIAL taped to the center of his palm. He removes the cap. The seatbelt sign goes dark. Cobb unbuckles, stands.  Fischer looks up.  Cobb holds up the open passport, comparing the picture to Fischer. Fischer's hand goes to his pocket. Cobb hands Fischer the passport.  Fischer gives Cobb a thin smile. Holds up his passport.  Fischer takes a beat. But Cobb seems harmless.  The Flight Attendant brings their drinks- Cobb takes them.  As he turns to Fischer he LOWERS his right hand ... a CLEAR LIQUID DROPS into Fischer's water as Cobb hands it to him.  Fischer grants him a smile.  "

S" Cobb reaches into the overhead for a blanket- lets it fall onto Fischer's head- Fischer doesn't flinch. ASLEEP. Cobb SIGNALS the others. The First Flight Attendant unlocks a CUPBOARD in the galley, then leaves, closing the curtain. Arthur moves into the galley and pulls out a MECHANISM CASE.  Cobb and Arthur open the mechanism- uncoil the tubes- feed them around the window side of each of the seats. Arthur rolls up Fischer's cuff- PUSHES the needle cap into Fischer's wrist. Arthur pulls Fischer's cuff down and hides the tubes behind the armrest of Fischer's seat.  Arthur runs the next tube to Ariadne. Cobb puts the case on Yusuf's lap. Yusuf checks the TIMERS, tapping the syringes. The others recline their seats. Yusuf HITS A BUTTON- closes the case- places it at his feet. He settles back, and we-   "

S" Arthur SLOWS in front of the TRAIN STATION, peering at the pedes pedestrians. He SPOTS Fischer, lights the cab's sign. Fischer FLAGS him down. Fischer JUMPS into the back, brushing rain from his shoulders.  Eames JUMPS in from the other side.  Saito gets into the front passenger seat. Pointing a gun.  Arthur pulls away. Fischer pulls out his wallet and tosses it at Eames.  Eames smiles at this.  A SHOT SHATTERS the window by Eames's head- another SHOT IMPACTS by Saito-  Arthur hits the gas, but a BLACK S.U.V. SKIDS sideways in front, BLOCKING the path-  A BLOCK BEHIND- Cobb is at a light. ARIADNE is getting in the front. Cobb has HEARD the GUNFIRE-  Cobb looks ahead to the AMBUSH, hits the gas- the sedan ROCKETS forwards... but BAM- A FREIGHT TRAIN CLIPS THE FRONT OF THE SEDAN, SHOVING IT SIDEWAYS AS AN ENDLESS TRAIN BARRELS PAST, A WALL BETWEEN COBB AND THE AMBUSH-  A SECOND S.U.V. is behind the cab- PLAIN CLOTHES SECURITY MEN advance through the traffic, weapons trained on the cab. Bullets RIP into the cab as Eames throws himself on top of Fischer, PULLING a SACK over his head-  Inside the sedan, Ariadne watches the train passing-  Cobb BACKS UP, SPINS around, heading for the tail of the train-  A Security Man emerges from the front S.U.V. carrying an AUTOMATIC RIFLE- he steps towards the cab through the rain, raises his weapon and BLASTS THE CAB'S WINDSCREEN-  Cobb clears the end of the train, and SKIDS across the tracks-  Arthur CROUCHES down- PUSHES the accelerator with his HAND- YANKS the wheel- FLYING BLIND. The cab NAILS the Security Man, CRUNCHING into the front S.U.V.-  Cobb SMASHES his car into the rear S.U.V., creating a GAP-  Arthur YANKS the transmission and REVERSES- SCRAPING through the gap- Security Men DIVE out of the way- Arthur throws a ragged J-turn to head down a SIDE STREET- Cobb follows in the other car. Rain whips across Arthur's face as he BREATHES-  Arthur looks at Saito. Saito's hand is at his belly. Covered in BLOOD.  "

Eames steps into the room, pulls his gun and moves over Saito.  Cobb GRABS Eames's arm.  Eames looks at Yusuf, then to Cobb.  Eames moves to Cobb. Looks him in the eye.  Cobb says nothing. Saito groans more loudly.  "

"Browning" yanks the sack from his head- it is now EAMES.  Arthur pulls a SNIPER RIFLE from a case by the van.  Cobb motions for Yusuf to follow his upstairs.  Arthur lines up a shot through the window-  Arthur SHOOTS two snipers. Cobb and Yusuf gently load Saito into the van. He groans. Ariadne straps him in, checks his bandages. Arthur can\'t get the last sniper- he\'s too hidden behind a wall-  Eames lines up a shot with a grenade launcher. Fires- the sniper EXPLODES into the air- Arthur looks at Eames.

S" Cobb JUMPS into the room, gun up. The room is empty. Arthur and Ariadne search the room. Saito and Eames arrive. Eames shuts the door. Arthur FINDS something-  Arthur holds up a MECHANISM CASE. Cobb shows it to Fischer.  Fischer's eyes roam over the dials and plungers.  Arthur is at the door. Someone is there. A key goes into the lock- the door starts to open- Arthur REACHES OVER and GRABS the person entering, THROWS THEM TO THE FLOOR- puts his gun in their face. IT IS BROWNING.  Fischer stares, disbelieving, at his own godfather.  Cobb pulls the key from Browning's hand: ROOM 528.  Fischer shakes his head. Looks at Browning. Thinking.  Browning looks up at Fischer.  Fischer takes this in. Devastated.  Fischer turns to Cobb.  Cobb looks at Browning.  Cobb nods at Arthur, who starts unpacking the mechanism. Browning watches. Silent.  Cobb rolls up his sleeve. Nods at Fischer to do the same.  Fischer looks Cobb in the eye. Decides- rolls up his sleeve, offering his bare arm. The team run tubes to each other- Arthur injects Fischer, whose head slumps.  Arthur hits buttons on the mechanism. The team goes out one by one. Cobb is last.  Cobb is no longer listening- he stares at the net curtains, BILLOWING like those in Mal's suite- a GLIMPSE of someone (Mal?) As the screen goes WHITE, and we are-  "

Cobb checks his SNIPER RIFLE, examines their objective: a massive FORTIFIED MEDICAL FACILITY a mile below.  Cobb turns to her. Eames, Saito and Fischer arrive, SKIING down from the hill above. Cobb pulls Eames out of Fischer's earshot.  Eames looks as Cobb, uneasy. Ariadne comes over.  They turn to Saito. Saito shrugs at Eames. Eames smiles.  Cobb moves to Fischer. Saito COUGHS. SPITS. Eames sees BLOOD on the snow. Looks at Saito.  Cobb taps Fischer's radio mike.  Cobb slips into his skis, shoulders his rifle.   "

As they move further in, the buildings become NEWER, different. Ariadne marvels at the extraordinary collection of buildings- every architectural style imaginable in waves of FAILED UTOPIAS.  A child's SHOUT echoes through the deserted canyons, prompting Cobb to look down a side street: a LITTLE BLONDE BOY crouched, his back to us. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy, and, as Cobb turns down the street, they run off.  Cobb and Ariadne emerge into a peculiar SQUARE lined with an eclectic mix of buildings, from APARTMENT BLOCKS to HOUSES.  Cobb pauses in front of a French country house. Staring.  Cobb leads Ariadne to the entrance of a glass skyscraper.  "

He is reaching for the SAFE next to his bed. His fingers fumble at the keypad, he can't open it. His son pushes 5,2,8,4,9,1 into the keypad. Opens it. Inside the safe is the WILL. And beside it is a HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, clearly made by a child. By Fischer. He takes it out, MARVELING at it. He turns to his father, but his father is dead.
