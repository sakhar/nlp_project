S"-- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) A dark, empty room.  The door bursts open. A MAN and WOMAN enter, drunk and giggling, horny as hell. No sooner is the door shut than they're all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at flesh, mouths locked together.  He gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over instead. Hell with it. He's got more urgent things to do, like getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. She arches, moaning, fumbling with his fly. He slams her against the wall, ripping her skirt. We hear fabric tear.  He enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the wall. She cries out, hitting her head against the wall but not caring, grinding against him, clawing his back, shivering with the sensations running through her. He carries her across the room with her legs wrapped around him. They fall onto the bed.  CAMERA PULLS BACK, exiting through the window, traveling smoothly outside...  "

S"-- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 3 ANDY DUFRESNE, mid-20's, wire rim glasses, three-piece suit. Under normal circumstances a respectable, solid citizen; hardly dangerous, perhaps even meek. But these circumstances are far from normal. He is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk. A cigarette smolders in his mouth. His eyes, flinty and hard, are riveted to the bungalow up the path.  He can hear them fucking from here.  He raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back. The radio plays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him:  You stepped out of a dream... You are too wonderful... To be what you seem...  He opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped in a rag. He lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully --  -- revealing a .38 revolver. Oily, black, evil.  He grabs a box of bullets. Spills them everywhere, all over the seats and floor. Clumsy. He picks bullets off his lap, loading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim. Six in the chamber. His gaze goes back to the bungalow.  He shuts off the radio. Abrupt silence, except for the distant lovers' moans. He takes another shot of bourbon courage, then opens the door and steps from the car.  "

S"-- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 4 His wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. Loose bullets scatter to the ground. The bourbon bottle drops and shatters.  He starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. The closer he gets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. Louder and more frenzied. The lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts.  Andy lurches to a stop, listening. The woman cries out in orgasm. The sound slams into Andy's brain like an icepick. He shuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop.  It finally does, dying away like a siren until all that's left is the shallow gasping and panting of post-coitus. We hear languorous laughter, moans of satisfaction.  Andy just stands and listens, devastated. He doesn't look like much of a killer now; he's just a sad little man on a dirt path in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun held loosely at his side. A pathetic figure, really.

S"Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence, you know all the facts. We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have foot prints. Tire tracks. Bullets scattered on the ground which bear his fingerprints. A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints. Most of all, we have a beautiful young woman and her lover lying dead in each other's arms. They had sinned. But was their crime so great as to merit a death sentence? "

S"I suspect Mr. Dufresne's answer to that would be yes. I further suspect he carried out that sentence on the night of September 21st, this year of our Lord, 1946, by pumping four bullets into his wife and another four into Glenn Quentin. And while you think about that, think about this... "

S"A revolver holds six bullets, not eight. I submit to you this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion! That could at least be understood, if not condoned. No, this was revenge of a much more brutal and cold-blooded nature. Consider! Four bullets per victim! Not six shots fired, but eight! That means he fired the gun empty...and then stopped to reload so he could shoot each of them again! An extra bullet per lover...right in the head. I'm done talking. You people are all decent, God-fearing Christian folk. You know what to do. "

Playing catch, shooting craps, jawing at each other, making deals. Exercise period.    RED emerges into fading daylight, slouches low-key through the activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing minor business. He's an important man here.  He slips somebody a pack of smokes, smooth sleight-of-hand.  TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS issue from the main tower, drawing everybody's attention to the loading dock. The outer gate swings open...revealing a gray prison bus outside.  Red is joined by HEYWOOD, SKEET, FLOYD, JIGGER, ERNIE, SNOOZE. Most cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer, but Red and his group mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably.  "

S"-- PRISON BUS -- DUSK (1947) 11 Andy sits in back, wearing steel collar and chains.  The bus lurches forward, RUMBLES through the gates. Andy gazes around, swallowed by prison walls.  GUARDS approach the bus with carbines. The door jerks open. The new fish disembark, chained together single-file, blinking sourly at their surroundings. Andy stumbles against the MAN in front of him, almost drags him down.  BYRON HADLEY, captain of the guard, slams his baton into Andy's back. Andy goes to his knees, gasping in pain. JEERS and SHOUTS from the spectators.  13 \tON THE BLEACHERS 13  Other hands go up. Red jots the names.  More hands go up. Andy and the others are paraded along, forced by their chains to take tiny baby steps, flinching under the barrage of jeers and shouts. The old-timers are shaking the fence, trying to make the newcomers shit their pants. Some of the new fish shout back, but mostly they look terrified. Especially Andy.  Red pockets his notepad. A VOICE comes over the P.A. speakers:  "

S"-- ADMITTING AREA -- DUSK (1947) 14 The new fish are marched in. Guards unlock the shackles. The chains drop away, rattling to the stone floor.  WARDEN SAMUEL NORTON strolls forth, a colorless man in a gray suit and a church pin in his lapel. He looks like he could piss ice water. He appraises the newcomers with flinty eyes.  Cued by Norton's glance, Hadley steps up to the con and screams right in his face:  Hadley rams the tip of his club into the con's belly. The man falls to his knees, gasping and clutching himself. Hadley takes his place at Norton's side again. Softly:  The men shed their clothes. Within seconds, all stand naked.  Hadley shoves the FIRST CON into a steel cage open at the front. TWO GUARDS open up with a fire hose. The con is slammed against the back of the cage, sputtering and hollering. Seconds later, the water is cut and the con yanked out.  The con gets a huge scoop of white delousing powder thrown all over him. Gasping and coughing, blinking powder from his eyes, he gets shoved to a trustee's cage. The TRUSTEE slides a short stack of items through the slot -- prison clothes and a Bible. All the men are processed quickly -- a blast of water, powder, clothes and a Bible...  "

The CONS in their cells greet them with TAUNTS, JEERS, and LAUGHTER. One by one, the new men are shown to their cells and locked in with a CLANG OF STEEL.  Red watches from his cell, arms slung over the crossbars, cigarette dangling from his fingers.  Red listens to the CLANGING below. He watches Andy and a few others being brought up to the 2nd tier.  Andy is led past and given a cell at the end of the tier.  '

S"-- CELLBLOCK -- NIGHT (1947) 29 The place goes nuts. Fat-Ass throws himself screaming against the bars. The entire block starts CHANTING:  The lights bump on. GUARDS pour in, led by Hadley himself.  Hadley arrives at Fat-Ass' cell, bellowing through the bars:  Fat-Ass keeps blubbering and wailing. Total freak-out. Hadley draws his baton, gestures to his men. Open it.  A GUARD unlocks the cell. Hadley pulls Fat-Ass out and starts beating him with the baton, brutally raining blows. Fat-Ass falls, tries to crawl.  The place goes dead silent. All we hear now is the dull THWACK-THWACK-THWACK of the baton. Fat-ass passes out. Hadley gets in a few more licks and finally stops.  The guards wrestle Fat-Ass onto a stretcher and carry him off. FOOTSTEPS echo away. Lights off. Darkness again. Silence.  "

S"-- MESS HALL -- MORNING (1947) 32 Andy goes through the breakfast line, gets a scoop of glop on his tray. WE PAN ANDY through the noise and confusion...and discover BOGS DIAMOND and ROOSTER MacBRIDE watching Andy go by. Bogs sizes Andy up with a salacious gleam in his eye, mutters something to Rooster. Rooster laughs.  Andy finds a table occupied by Red and his regulars, chooses a spot at the end where nobody is sitting. Ignoring their stares, he picks up his spoon -- and pauses, seeing something in his food. He carefully fishes it out with his fingers.  It's a squirming maggot. Andy grimaces, unsure what to do with it. BROOKS HATLEN is sitting closest to Andy. At age 65, he's a senior citizen, a long-standing resident.  Andy passes the maggot to Brooks. Brooks examines it, rolling it between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine cigar. Andy is riveted with apprehension.  Andy can't bear to watch. Brooks opens up his sweater and feeds the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket. Andy breathes a sigh of relief.  Andy nods, proceeds to eat. Carefully. Heywood approaches.  Heywood plops his tray down, sits. The men start pulling out cigarettes and handing them down.  An impressive pile forms. Heywood bends down and inhales deeply, smelling the aroma. Rapture.  He shakes his head, turns back to his food. The silence mounts. Heywood glances around. Men resume eating. Softly:  "

Bogs looms from the billowing steam, smiling, checking Andy up and down. Rooster and PETE appear from the sides. The Sisters.  You're some sweet punk. You been broke in yet?  Andy tries to step past them. He gets shoved around, nothing serious, just some slap and tickle. Jackals sizing up prey.  Andy breaks free, flushed and shaking. He hurries off, leaving the three Sisters laughing.  "

S"-- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1947) 36 Exercise period. Red plays catch with Heywood and Jigger, lazily tossing a baseball around. Red notices Andy off to the side. Nods hello. Andy takes this as a cue to amble over. Heywood and Jigger pause, watching.  Red glances at the hand, ignores it. The game continues.  Red gives Andy a look. See?   Heywood nudges Jigger. Watch this. He winds up and throws the ball hard -- right at Andy's head. Andy sees it coming out of the corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. Beat. He sends the ball right back, zinging it into Heywood's hands. Heywood drops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands.   Andy squats, motions Red to join him. Andy grabs a handful of dirt and sifts it through his hands. He finds a pebble and rubs it clean. It has a nice milky glow. He tosses it to Red.  Red flicks his gaze past Andy. Bogs is watching them.  You'll know when you see the rock- hammer.  They shake. Andy strolls off. Red watches him go.  "

He rolls his cart to Andy's cell, mutters through the bars:  Andy's hand snakes through the bars and makes the object disappear. The hand comes back and deposits a small slip of folded paper along with more cigarettes. Brooks turns his cart around and goes back. He pauses, sorting his books long enough for Red to snag the slip of paper. Brooks continues on, scooping the cigarettes off the cart and into his pocket.  "

S'-- BACK ROOMS/STOCK AREA -- DAY (1947) 46 -- a dark, tangled maze of rooms and corridors, boilers and furnaces, sump pumps, old washing machines, pallets of cleaning supplies and detergents, you name it. Andy hefts a cardboard drum of Hexlite off the stack, turns around --  -- and finds Bogs Diamond in the aisle. blocking his way. Rooster looms from the shadows to his right, Pete Verness on the left. A frozen beat. Andy slams the Hexlite to the floor, rips off the top, and scoops out a double handful.  Andy backs up, holding them at bay, trying to maneuver through the maze. The Sisters keep coming, tense and guarded, eyes riveted and gauging his every move, trying to outflank him. Andy trips on some old gaint sugglies. That\'s all it takes. They\'re on him in an instant, kicking and stomping.  Andy gets yanked to his feet. Bogs applies a chokehold from behind. They propel him across the room and slam him against an old four-pocket machine, bending him over it. Rooster jams a rag into Andy\'s mouth and secures it with a steel pipe, like a horse bit. Andy kicks and struggles, but Rooster and Pete have his arms firmly pinned. Bogs whispers in Andy\'s ear:  Andy starts screaming, muffled by the rag. CAMERA PULLS BACK, SLOWLY WIDENING. The big Washex blocks our view. All we see is Andy\'s screaming face and the men holding him down...  ...and CAMERA DRIFTS FROM THE ROOM, leaving the dark place and the dingy act behind...MOVING up empty corridors, past concrete walls and steel pipes...  WE EMERGE into the prison laundry past a guard, WIDENING for a final view of the line. The giant steel "mangler" is slapping down in brutal rhythm. The sound is deafening.  PRISON MONTAGE: (1947 through 1949)  47 \tANDY PLODS THROUGH HIS DAYS. WORKING. EATING. CHIPPING AND 47 shaping his rocks after lights-out...  48 \tANDY WALKS THE YARD, FACE SWOLLEN AND BRUISED. 48  49 \tANDY EATS BREAKFAST. A FEW TABLES OVER, BOGS BLOWS HIM A KISS. 49  50 \tANDY BACKS INTO A CORNER IN SOME DINGY PART OF THE PRISON, wildly swinging a rake at his tormentors.

S"-- LICENSE PLATE FACTORY -- DAY (1949) 57 A tar-cooker bubbles and smokes. TWO CONS dip up a bucket of tar and tie a rope to the handle. The rope goes taught. CAMERA FOLLOWS the bucket of tar up the side of the building to --  58 \tTHE ROOF 58  -- where it is relayed to the work detail. the men are dipping big Padd brushes and spreading the tar. ANGLZ OVER to Byron Hadley bitching sourly to his fellow guards:  The prisoners keep spreading tar, eyes on their work.  Red glances over -- and is shocked to see Andy standing up, listening to the guards talk.  Andy tosses his Padd in the bucket and strolls toward Hadley.  The guards stiffen at Andy's approach. Youngblood's hand goes to his holster. The tower guards CLICK-CLACK their rifle bolts. Hadley turns, stupefied to find Andy there.  Hadley grabs Andy's collar and propels him violently toward the edge of the roof. The cons furiously keep spreading tar.  Hadley abruptly jerks Andy to a stop right at the edge. In fact, Andy's past the edge, beyond his balance, shoetips scraping the roof. The only thing between him and an ugly drop to the concrete is Hadley's grip on the front of his shirt.  The cons are pausing work, stunned by this business discussion.  Hadley freezes him with a look. Andy presses on:  The convicts stand gaping, all pretense of work gone. They look like they've been pole-axed. Hadley shoots them a look.  "

S"-- AUDITORIUM CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1949) 65 Andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. Two dark figures loom in the corridor, blocking his path. Rooster and Pete. Andy turns back -- and runs right into Bogs. Instant bear hug. The Sisters are on him like a flash. They kick a door open and drag him into --  66 \tTHE PROJECTION BOOTH 66  -- where they confront the startled PROJECTIONIST, an old con blinking at them through thick bifocals.  Terrified, the old man darts past and out the door. Pete slams and locks it. Bogs shoves Andy to the center of the room.  Andy sighs, cocks his head at the projector.  Seemingly resigned, Andy turns around, leans on the rewind bench -- and curls his fingers around a full 1.000 foot reel of 35mm film. Rooster licks his lips, pushes past the others.  Andy whips the reel of film around in a vicious arc, smashing it into Rooster's face and bouncing him off the wall.  Andy fights like hell, but is soon overpowered and forced to his knees. Bogs steps to Andy, pulls out an awl with a vicious eight-inch spike, gives him a good long look at it.  The Sisters consider this carefully. The film runs out of the projector, flapping on the reel. The screen goes white.  Andy gets a bootheel in the face. The Sisters start kicking and beating the living shit out of him with anything they can get their hands on. In the theater, the convicts are CHANTING AND CLAPPING for the movie to come back on.  "

S'-- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- 3RD TIER -- DUSK (1949) 69 Bogs comes up the stairs, smoking a cigarette. Not many cons around; the place is virtually deserted. A VOICE echoes dimly over the P.A. system:  Bogs enters his cell. Dark in here. He fumbles for the light cord, yanks it. The sudden light reveals Captain Hadley six inches from his face, waiting for him. Mert steps in behind Bogs. hemming him.  Before Bogs can even open his mouth to say "what the fuck," Hadley rams the tip of his baton brutally into his solar plexus. Bogs doubles over, gagging his wind out.  70 \tGROUND FLOOR 70  Ernie comes slowly around the corner, rolling a steel mop cart loaded with supplies.  71 \t2ND TIER 71  Red is darning a sock in his open cell. He pauses, frowning, hearing strange THUMPING sounds. What the hell is that?  72 \t3RD TIER 72  It\'s Hadley and Mert methodically and brutally pulping Bogs with their batons, and kicking the shit out of him for good measure. He feebly tries to ward them off.  73 \t2ND TIER 73  Puzzled, Red steps from his cell, following the sound. It dawns on him that it\'s coming from above. He moves to the railing and leans out, craning around to look up --  74 \tRED\'S POV 74  -- just as Bogs flips over the railing and comes sailing  directly toward us, eyes bugging out, SCREAMING as he falls.  75 \tRED (SLOW MOTION) 75  jumps back as Bogs plummets past, missing him by inches, arms swimming and trying to grab the railing (but missing that too), SCREAMING aaaaalll the way down --  76 \tGROUND FLOOR 76  -- and impacting on Ernie\'s gassing mop cart in an enormous eruption of solvents and cleansers. The cart is squashed flat, shooting out from under Bogs and skidding across the cellblock floor like a tiddly wink, kicking up sparks for thirty yards. Ernie is left gaping in shock at Bogs and all the Bogs-related wreckage at his feet.  77 \t2ND TIER 77  Red is stunned. He very tentatively leans out and looks up. Above him, Hadley and Mert lean on the 3rd tier railing. Hadley tilts the cap back on his head, shakes his head.  A tiny drop of blood drips off the toe of Hadley\'s shoe and  splashes across Red\'s upturned cheek. He wipes it off, then looks down at Bogs. Cons and guards are racing to the scene.  7B\tEXT -- PRISON YARD/LOADING DOCK -- DAY (1949) 78  Bogs, wheelchair-bound and wearing a neck brace, is loaded onto an ambulance for transport. Behind the fence stand Red and his friends, watching.  '

S"-- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1949) 85 Ernie is mopping the floor. He glances back and sees Warden Norton approach the cellblock with an entourage of a DOZEN GUARDS. Still mopping, Ernie mutters to the nearest cell:  Word travels fast from cell to cell. Cons scramble to tidy up and hide things. Norton enters, nods to his men. The guards pair off in all directions, making their choices at random.  Cells are opened, occupants displaced, items scattered, mattresses overturned. Whatever contraband is found gets tossed out onto the cellblock floor. Mostly harmless stuff.  A GUARD pulls a sharpened screwdriver out of a mattress, shoots a nasty look at the CON responsible.  The man is taken away. Norton's gaze goes up.  86 \t2ND TIER 86  Norton arrives, makes a thin show of picking a cell at random. He motions at Andy on his bunk, reading his Bible. The door is unlocked. Norton enters, trailed by his men. Andy rises.  Norton gives a curt nod. Hadley and Trout start tossing the cell in a thorough search. Norton keeps his eyes on Andy, looking for a wrong glance or nervous blink. He takes the Bible out of Andy's hand.   Andy glances over. Hadley is holding up a rock blanket, a polishing cloth roughly the size of an oven mitt.  Hadley glances at the rocks lining the window sill, turns to Norton.  Norton nods, strolls to the poster of Rita.  Norton exits, the guards follow. The cell door is slammed and locked. Norton pauses, turns back.  He reaches through the bars and returns the Bible to Andy.  Norton and his men walk away.  "

Something about this doesn't make any sense.  91 \tANDY STEPS BACK INTO THE OUTER ROOMS AND FINDS HADLEY WITH 91 another GUARD, a huge fellow named DEKINS.  Hadley exits. Dekins approaches Andy ominously. Andy stands his ground, waiting for whatever comes next. Finally:  Andy covers his surprise. Glances at Brooks. Brooks smiles.  Andy and Dekins grab a desk standing on end and tilt it to the floor. They find chairs and settle in. Brooks returns with a tablet of paper and a pen, slides them before Andy.  "

S"-- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1953) 101 Dark. Andy's in his bunk, polishing a four-inch length of quartz. It's a beautifully-crafted chess piece in the shape of a horse's head, poise and nobility captured in gleaming stone.  He puts the knight on a chess board by his bed, adding it to four pieces already there: a king, a queen, and two bishops. He turns to Rita. Moonlight casts bars across her face.  "

S"-- PRISON LIBRARY/ANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY (1954) 103 Floyd rushes in with Andy and Red at his heels. They find Jigger and Snooze trying to calm Brooks, who has Heywood in a chokehold and a knife to his throat. Heywood is terrified.  He kicks a table over. Tax files explode through the air.  Andy steps forward, rivets Brooks with a gaze. Softly:  Brooks bursts into tears. The storm is over. Heywood staggers free, gasping for air. Andy takes the knife, passes it to Red. Brooks dissolves into Andy's arms with great heaving sobs.  Red and Andy exchange a surprised look. Andy wants to understand. Red just motions to let it be for now. He puts his arm around Brooks, who sobs inconsolably. Softly:  Ain't that bad, old hoss. Won't be long till you're squiring pretty young girls on your arm and telling 'em lies.  "

S'-- BROOKS\' ROOM -- SHORTLY LATER (1954) 119 Brooks is dressed in his suit. He finishes knotting his tie, puts his hat on his head. The letter lies on the desk, stampe3 and ready for mailing. His bag is by the door.  He takes one last look around. Only one thing left to do. He steps to a wooden chair in the center of the room, pulls out s pocketknife, and glances up at the ceiling beam.  He steps up onto the chair. It wobbles queasily. Now facing the beam, he carves a message into the wood: "Brooks Hatlen was here." He smiles with a sort of inner peace.  120 \tTIGHT ON CHAIR 120  His weight shifts on the wobbly chair -- and it goes out from under him. His feet remain where they are, kicking feebly in mid-air. His hat falls to the floor.  ANGLE WIDENS. Brooks has hanged himself. He swings gently, facing the open window. Traffic noise floats up from below.  '

S'-- FIELDS -- DAY (1954) 124 Low hilly terrain all around. A HUNDRED CONS are at work in the fields. GUARDS patrol with carbines, keeping a sharp eye. We find Andy, Red, and the boys working with picks and shovels. They glance over to the pickup truck. Hadley\'s chewing the fat with Mert and Youngblood. A WHISTLE BLOWS.  The work stops. Cons head for the pickup truck, where water is dispensed with dipper and pail. Red and the boys look to Andy. Andy nods. Now\'s the time. The group moves off through the confusion, using it as cover. They head up the slope of a nearby hill and quickly decide on a suitable spot. The guards haven\'t noticed.  Jigger and Floyd start swinging picks into the soft earth, quickly ripping out a hole. Red reaches into his jacket and pulls out a beautiful wooden box, carefully stained and varnished. He shows it around to nods of approval.  124 \tCONTINUED 124 Heywood jumps in and starts spading out the hole.  125 \tBY THE TRUCK 125  Youngblood glances up and sees the men on the slope.  Suddenly, other cons start breaking away in groups, dozens of them heading toward the slope. The guards look around.  126 \tON THE SLOPE 126  Andy pulls a towel-wrapped bundle from his jacket and unfolds it. Jake. Andy lays him in the box, followed by Brook\'s letter. Red places the casket in the hole. A moment of silence. Andy gives Red with an encouraging nod.  Muttered "amens" all around. The boys shovel dirt onto the small grave and tamp it down.  '

S'-- GUARD DESK/WARDEN\'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 129 Dozens of parcel boxes litter the floor. WILEY, the duty guard, picks through them. Hadley enters, trailed by Andy.  Wiley thrusts an envelope at Andy. Andy just stares at it.  Andy takes the envelope, pulls out a letter, reads:  Wiley grins. Hadley glares at him. The grin vanishes.  Andy gazes around at the boxes. The riches of the world lay at his feet. His eyes mist with emotion at the sight.  Hadley exits. Andy touches the boxes like a love-struck man touching a beautiful woman. Wiley grins.  Andy nods. Wiley disappears into the toilet, Jughead Comix in hand. Alone now, Andy starts going through the boxes like a starving man exploring packages of food. He doesn\'t know where to turn first. He gets giddy, ripping boxes open and pulling out books, touching them, smelling them.  He rips open another box. This one contains an old phonograph player, industrial gray and green, the words "Portland Public School District" stenciled on the side. The box also contains stacks and stacks of used record albums.  Andy reverently slips a stack from the box and starts flipping through them. Used Nat King Coles, Bing Crosbys, etc. He comes across a certain album -- Mozart\'s "Le Nozze de Figaro." He pulls it from the stack, gazing upon it as a man transfixed. It is a thing of beauty. It is the Grail.  '

The needle HISSES in the groove...and the MUSIC begins, lilting and gorgeous. Andy sinks into Wiley\'s chair, overcome by its beauty.

S"-- WOODED FIELDS -- DAY (1965) 164 A ROAD-GANG is pulling stumps, bogged down in mud.  Norton strolls into view with NED GRIMES at his heels.  Norton opens the box. Alongside the pie is an envelope. He runs his thumb across the thick stack of cash it contains.  IN THE BACKGROUND, a winch cable SNAPS and whips through the air, damn near severing a man's leg. He goes down, screaming in mud and blood, pinned by a fallen tree stump. Men rush over to help him. Norton barely takes notice.  "

Kind of roomie you pray you don\'t get, know what I\'m sayin\'? 6 to 12 for armed burglary. Said he done hundreds of jobs. Hard to believe, high-strung as he was. Cut a loud fart, he\'d go three feet in the air. Talked all the time, too, that\'s the other thing. Never shut up. Places he\'d been, jobs he pulled, women he fucked. Even people he killed. People that gave him shit, that\'s how he put it. One night, like a joke, I say: "Yeah? Who\'d you kill?" So he says... '

He stares at it. Red peers over his shoulder.  He gets hemmed in by the older men. Red snatches the letter.  Red rips it open, scans the letter. Expressionless.  '

S"-- PRISON -- NIGHT (1966) 198 A steel door rattles open. Mert leads Tommy outside to a gate, unlocks it. Tommy looks around.  Mert swings the gate open, sends Tommy through, turns and heads back inside. Tommy proceeds out across a loading-dock access for the shops and mills. Some vehicles parked. The place is deserted. He stops, sensing a presence.  Norton steps into the light.  Norton pulls a pack of cigarettes, offers Tommy a smoke. Tommy takes one. Norton lights both cigarettes, pockets his lighter.  Norton drops his cigarette. Crushes it out with the toe of his shoe. Glances up toward the plate shop roof as --  199 \tHIGH ANGLE FROM PLATE SHOP ROOF (SNIPER POV) 199  -- a rifle scope pops up into frame, jumping Tommy's image into startling magnification, framed in the crosshairs.  200 \tTHE SNIPER 200  rapid-fires a carbine -- BLAM!BLAM!BLAM!BLAM! -- his face lit up by the muzzle flashes.

S"-- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1966) 205 Red finds Andy sitting in the shadow of the high stone wall, poking listlessly through the dust for small pebbles. Red waits for some acknowledgment. Andy doesn't even look up. Red hunkers down and joins him. Nothing is said for the longest time. And then, softly:  Andy finally glances to Red, seeking a reaction. Silence.  Andy smiles faintly in spite of himself. Red gives his  shoulder a squeeze.  Red stares at Andy, laughs.  -  Red snaps a look. What the hell does that mean? Andy rises and walks away. Red lunges to his feet.    Andy turns and walks away.  "

Norton pokes his head in.  We follow Norton to his wife's sampler. He swings it aside, works the combination dial, opens the wall safe. Andy moves up, shoves in the black ledger and files. Norton shuts the safe.  Andy hands him the envelopes. Norton heads for the door.  Norton exits. Andy turns to the laundry. He opens the shoebox. Nice pair of dress shoes inside. He sighs, glances down at the old ragged pair of work shoes on his own feet.  "

Suddenly the count stalls:  The head bull, HAIG, checks his list:  Still no answer. Glaring, Haig stalks down the tier, clipboard in hand. His men fall in behind.  They arrive at bars. Their faces go slack. Stunned. Softly:  Oh my Holy God.  216 \tREVERSE ANGLE 216  reveals the cell is empty. Everything neat and tidy. Even the bunk is stowed. They wrench the door open and rush in, tossing the cell in a panic as if Andy might be lurking under the Kleenex or the toothpaste.

S"-- ANDY'S CELL -- DAY (1966) 220 Norton steps to the center of the room, working himself up into a fine rage:  Norton grabs the clipboard and thrusts it at Hadley.  Haig scurries out, gathering men. Norton spins to Red.  Norton spreads his arms evangelist-style, spins slowly around.  Red exchanges looks with the guards. Even they're nervous. Norton scoops a handful rocks off the sill. He hurls them at the wall one at a time, shattering them, punctuating his words:  He sends the last rock whizzing right at Racquel. No smash.  It takes a moment for this to sink in. All eyes go to her. The rock went through her. There's a small hole in the poster where her navel used to be.  You could hear a pin drop. Norton reaches up, sinks his finger into the hole. He keeps pushing...and his entire hand disappears into the wall.  221 \tANGLE FROM BEHIND POSTER 221  as Norton rips the poster from before our eyes. Stunned faces peer in. CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK...to reveal the long crumbling tunnel in the wall.  "

S"-- VERTICAL SHAFT -- DAY (1966) 224 Dark as midnight. Concrete walls rise on both sides. If you imagine them as two huge slices of bread, the meat of this particular sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark tangle of pipes between the cellblocks. Rory's appears, shining his flashlight down the shaft. Somewhere, a rat SQUEAKS.  Looking none too happy about it, Rory squeezes from the tunnel and dangles into the shaft. He gets lowered, shining his light, smothered by darkness. Not having a good time.  His feet touch the ground -- or what he assumed was the ground. It's not. In fact, it's just what it smells like. He sinks in past his ankles. He slips and sits heavily in it.  "

Norton turns, strolls out of frame.  Again we see: Andy working. Norton pokes his head in.  Norton crosses to the wall safe and works the dial, his back turned. This time, though, we stay on Andy:  He pulls up his sweater, yanks out a large black book and a stack of files, lays them on the desk. He then grabs the real ledger and files, jams them down his pants and smoothes his sweater down. He picks up the bogus stack, crosses to Norton, and shoves everything in.  "

He dangles wildly upside-down for a moment, arms windmilling, then gets his hands pressed firmly against the opposite wall. The rat scurries off, pissed.  Andy snags the conduit again. He contorts out of the hole and dangles into the shaft. We now see the purpose for the rope: the plastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack,  He kicks his legs across the shaft, gets his feet braced. Wit3 his back against one wall and feet against the other, he starts down the shaft. Sliding dangerously. Using pipes for handholds. Flinching as rats dart this way and that, scurrying in the shadows. He drops the last few feet to the bottom.  He approaches the ceramic sewer pipe and kneels before it. Pulls out the rock-hammer and says a quick silent prayer. Raises the rock-hammer high and swings it down with all his might. Once, twice -- third time lucky. An enormous eruption of sewage cascades into the air as if rocket-propelled, the Mount St. Helens of shit. Andy is instantly coated black. He turns away and heaves his guts out. The shit keeps coming.  '

Fingers appear, thrusting through the heavy-gauge wire mesh covering the mouth of the pipe. Andy's face looms from the darkness, peering out at freedom. He wrenches the mesh loose, pushes himself out, and plunges head-first into the creek. He comes up sputtering for breath. The water is waist-deep.  He wades upstream, ripping his clothes from his body. He gets his shirt off, spins it through the air over his head, flings the shirt away. He raises his arms to the sky, turning slowly, feeling the rain washing him clean. Exultant. Triumphant. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING arcs from horizon to horizon.  "

S"-- PRISON CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 270 Red is sleeping. He wakes with a start.  He senses a presence, looks over his shoulder. There's a Rita Hayworth poster on his wall. He gets out of bed. Rita just  keeps smiling, inscrutable. As Red watches, a brilliant round glow builds behind the poster, shining from the tunnel. The poster rips free, charred to ash in the blink of an eye as a shaft of holy white light stabs into the cell. Sunlight. Red staggers back against the glare.  A whirlwind kicks up, whipping everything into the air. The hole in the wall is like a giant vacuum cleaner -- papers, book, toiletries, bedding -- if it ain't nailed down, it gets sucked down the hole toward the light. Red fights it, but the suction drags him closer and closer...  271 \tRED'S POV 271  ...and CAMERA rockets into the hole, getting sucked down an endless tunnel at impossible speed, the ROAR of air mixing with his drawn-out SCREAM, closer and closer to the light...  ...and erupting out the other side into total silence and a beautiful white beach. The Pacific Ocean before us. Enormous. Mind-blowing. Beautiful beyond description. All we hear now are the gentle sound of waves.  A lone figure stands at water's edge. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING, coming up behind him and TRACKING AROUND to reveal -- Red.  272 \tAERIAL SHOT 272  Nothing for a million miles but beach, sky, and water. Red is a tiny speck at water's edge.

The kids get swept off by MOM. Red starts bagging the next customer. SLOW PUSH IN on Red. Surrounded by MOTION and NOISE. Feeling like the eye of a hurricane. People everywhere, whipping around him like a gale. Strange. Loud. Dizzying. It gets distorted and weird, slow and thick, pressing in on him from all sides. The noise level intensifies. The hollering of children deepens and distends into LOW EERIE HOWLS.  He\'s in the grip of a major anxiety attack. Tries to shake himself out of it. Can\'t. Fumbles the final items into the bag. Walks away. Trying not to panic. Trying not to run.  He makes his way through the store. Blinking sweat. He bumps into a lady\'s cart, mumbles an apology, keeps going. Breaks into a trot. Down the aisle, cut to the left, through the door into the back rooms, faster and faster, running now, slamming through a door marked "Employees Only" into --  '

He goes to the sink, splashes his face, tries to calm down. He can still hear them out there. They won't go away. He glances around the restroom. Small. Not small enough.  He enters a stall. Locks the door. Puts the toilet lid down and sits on the john. Better. He can actually reach out and touch the walls now. They're close. Safe. Almost small enough. He draws his feet up so he can't be seen if somebody walks in.  He'll just sit here for a while. Until he calms down.  "

S'-- HAYFIELD -- DAY 292 Red walks the long rock wall, nearing the tree. A squirrel scolds him from a low branch, scurries up higher. Red studies the base of the wall. Nothing unusual here. Just a bunch of rocks set in stone. He sighs. Fool\'s errand. Turns to go.  Something catches his eye. He walks back, squats, peering closer. Wets a fingertip and rubs a stone. A layer of dust comes off. Volcanic glass. Gleaming black. He tries to get the rock out, anticipation growing. It won\'t come; it\'s too smooth. He pulls a pocketknife and levers the rock free. It tumbles at his feet, leaving a ragged hole.  Red leans down and solves the mystery at last, staring at the object buried under the rock. Stunned. It\'s an envelope wrapped in plastic. Written on it is a single word: "Red."  Red pulls the envelope out and rises. He just stares at it for a while, almost afraid to open it. But open it he does. Inside is a smaller envelope and a letter. Red begins to read:  By now, tears are spilling silently down Red\'s cheeks. He opens the other envelope and fans out a stack of new fifty- dollar bills. Twenty of them. A thousand dollars.  '
