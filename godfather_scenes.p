a(S'BONASERA'
p45
S'I raised my daughter in the American fashion; I gave her freedom, but taught her never to dishonor her family.  She found a boy friend, not an Italian.  She went to the movies with him, stayed out late. Two months ago he took her for a drive, with another boy friend. They made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her.  She resisted; she kept her honor.  So they beat her like an animal.  When I went to the hospital her nose was broken, her jaw was shattered and held together by wire, and she could not even weep because of the pain. '
p46
tp47
a(S'BONASERA'
p48
S'I went to the Police like a good American.  These two boys were arrested and brought to trial.  The judge sentenced them to three years in prison, and suspended the sentence.  Suspended sentence! They went free that very day.  I stood in the courtroom like a fool, and those bastards, they smiled at me.  Then I said to my wife, for Justice, we must go to The Godfather. '

But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.

S'DAY: DON\'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) The PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black background.  There is a moment\'s hesitation, and then the simple words in white lettering:  While this remains, we hear: "I believe in America." Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great emotion.  As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.  He can barely speak; he is weeping now.  By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone\'s office in his home.  The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with patterned shadows.  We are watching BONASERA over the shoulder of DON CORLEONE.  TOM HAGEN sits near a small table, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a glass of wine.  We can HEAR music, and the laughter and voices of many people outside.  BONASERA whispers into the DON\'s ear.  Both HAGEN and SONNY react.  Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.  '

S'DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) A HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight.  There are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard and gardens.  There is music and laughing and dancing and countless tables covered with food and wine.  DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of the wedding party.  He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the children, and makes them all welcome.  They in turn carry with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.  The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE, MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the bride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI.  As they move into the pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.  Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves back to the house.  SONNY gives a delicious smile in the direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI.  She returns it.  Then he moves to his wife.  HAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine barrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait.  TOM crooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is next, straightens, and follows HAGEN.  '

S"DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945) Outside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits, working together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers down in their notebooks.  We HEAR the music and laughter coming from the party in the distance.  A MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.  BARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the watchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to embrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.  The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another number in the notebook.  A shiney new Cadillac with wooden bumpers.  PETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping bellies with the ladies.  He mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief. PAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings it to him.  PAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps back into the dance.  The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another number in the notebook.  TESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR- OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his enormous brown shoes.  The MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by CLEMENZA and PAULIE.  The MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the sedan.  SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him. The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card, without saying a word.  SONNY steps back, spits on the ground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE, and another TWO MEN.  He doesn't say a thing for most of the walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.  "

S"DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945) CONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her overly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI.  He is bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples. She absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from him long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white envelopes they are putting into the large white purse she holds.  In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one of her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt, where she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest. CARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the bulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the things hold.  Discreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin.  The purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm, is fat with money.  A little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking eyes from the purse.  SONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY MANCINI, the Maid of Honor.  Every once in a while he glances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with some WOMEN.  He bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear.  SANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh.  SANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter. Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais. SONNY and LUCY are gone.  "

S'DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945) KAY and MICHAEL.  She has picked out LUCA BRASI.  She starts to eat her spaghetti.  She begins eating, looking at him eagerly.  The smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a tall story.  LUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near their table.  HAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously following.  '

S"The action is narcotics.  Sollozzo has contacts in Turkey for the poppy, in Sicily for the plants to process down to morphine or up to heroin.  Also he has access to this country.  He's coming to us for financial help, and some sort of immunity from the law.  For that we get a piece of the action, I couldn't find out how much. Sollozzo is vouched for by the Tattaglia family, and they may have a piece of the action.  They call Sollozzo the Turk. He's spent a lot of time in Turkey and is suppose to have a Turkish wife and kids.  He's suppose to be very quick with the knife, or was, when he was younger.  Only in matters of business and with some reasonable complaint.  Also he has an American wife and three children and he is a good family man. "

S"DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) DON CORLEONE at the window.  He has seen the intimacy of the YOUNG COUPLE.  THE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves forward to kiss his hand.  He takes the envelope from his jacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes a formal speech.  THE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so tightly we might imagine it to be painful.  He turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with the same formality he entered with.  DON CORLEONE breathes more easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.  DON CORLEONE is not pleased.  THE DON nods.  We now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers from outside.  In Italian, with unmistakable style.  He moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the room with light.  "

S"DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945) Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing.  The DON smiles.  SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still adjusting his clothes.  The DON is silent, stern.  He glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as he can.  He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough to hurt.  He closes the door, smiling to himself.  Turns to HAGEN.  This saddens the DON.  He sighs.  "

S'DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945) Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over the entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument of his gratitude.  The CROWD is favorably impressed: they begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses, in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and kiss the Groom.  Louder and louder, five hundred forks hitting five hundred glasses.  '

S"DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945) A long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can see a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but all plump and dressed in black.  DON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end.  But then the DON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder.  MICHAEL stops and turns toward his FATHER.  The two looks at one another for some time.  SILENCE.  DON CORLEONE then lifts his hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's uniform.  Again they regard each other without a word.  MICHAEL turns, and continues on.  DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then follows.  "

S'DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945) DON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR VIEW.  He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.  GENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man.  DON CORLEONE takes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around his bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.  The DON motions all the others to leave the room.  They do. He returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.  '

S'DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945) Looking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO\'s footsteps before he actually rises into view.  He is a small man, very dark, with curly black hair.  But wiry, and tight and hard, and obviously very dangerous.  He is greeted at the head of the stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it, introducing himself.  For a moment, there is a complex of handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful introductions.  Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON\'s glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced. They are very respectful of one another.  Folding chairs are brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around in a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE, CLEMENZA and TESSIO.  The DON is the slightest bit foolish with all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no one.  Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear that this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.  SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.  There is a long silence; in which each person present feels the tension.  The DON is about to give his answer.  We feel this around the room.  SOLLOZZO takes a breath.  This startles SONNY; he blurts out.  SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face him.  Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out of line.  SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal.  He glances one last time at SONNY.  He rises; all the others do as well.  He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally takes his leave.  When the footsteps can no longer be heard:  The DON turns to SONNY.  TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display with the word "THANK YOU" spelled out in flowers.  '

S"DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945) It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man, presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping.  Soft light bathes the room from the large windows.  We move closer to him until we see his face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ.  He turns uncomfortably; mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets.  Something wet.  He wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet. He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood.  He is frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on his sheets and pajamas.  He grunts, pulls the puddle of blood in his bed.  He feels his own body frantically, moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face with the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of his bed.  Just blood from the hacked neck.  White reedy tendons show.  He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle of blood to see more clearly.  Froth covers the muzzle, and the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered with blood.  WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot.  No sound comes out. Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.  "

TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork.  He smiles.  MICHAEL has hung up.  He looks at the piles of work, and can't face it.  He rises, puts on his coat and hat, and continues out.  He peeks into the DON's office.  The DON smiles and nods.  TOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE. FREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the afternoon paper.  He puts aside the papers the office manager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE, raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the paper.  FREDDIE leaves.  He slowly puts on his jacket.  Looks out his window.  "

They have passed a little enclosed newsstand.  KAY sees something that terrifies her.  She doesn\'t know what to do. MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.  She cannot answer him.  Rather she pulls him by the arm, back to the newsstand, and points.  His face goes grave.  The headlines read: "VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED DOWN."  MICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them.  KAY knows to remain silent.  '

S'DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945) DON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the car, when TWO MEN step from the corner.  Suddenly, the DON drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness toward the parked car.  The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins rolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.  Five bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain, and continues toward the car.  The PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking over an entire case of fruit.  The TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off.  Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit.  There are more GUNSHOTS.  FREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car; having difficulty opening the door.  He rushes out, a gun trembling in his hand; his mouth open.  He actually drops the gun.  The gun falls amid the rolling fruit.  The GUNMEN are panicked.  They fire once more at the downed DON CORLEONE.  His leg and arm twitch where they are hit; and pools of blood are beginning to form.  The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion; they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.  The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared: rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely from around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from windows.  But the street itself is now empty.  FREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great puddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and face down in them.  FREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying something we cannot understand.  He begins to weep profusely.  '

S"NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945) The main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless glistening wooden floors.  Now, at this late time, the chairs have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR is waxing them.  A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her receipts.  LUCA moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at the bar.  ANOTHER MAN, dark and very well-built, moves behind the bar.  LUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.  LUCA Nods.  LUCA listens.  LUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good.  SOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it, rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth. BRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter magically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette.  Then, he does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and puts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.  "

S"NITE: SONNY'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945) The telephone in SONNY's house is ringing.  He approaches it, obviously fresh from a nap.   SONNY cradles the phone.  An incredible rage builds up in him, his face actually turning red.  He would like to rip the phone to pieces in his bare hands.  Then he controls it. Quickly, he dials another number.  He hangs up.  There is a POUNDING on the door.  A BABY starts crying.  SONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and moves quickly.  He opens the front door quickly.  It is CLEMENZA.  He enters, SONNY closes the door.  SANDRA goes to look after the baby.  CLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the couch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.  The telephone rings again.  SONNY answers it.  SANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is.  SONNY indicates that she be quiet.  "

S"NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945) SONNY walks into the empty, darkened house.  Then he calls out.  The kitchen door swings open.  He moves quickly and takes her by the arm.  He is deliberately calm.  She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs.  SONNY turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying.  He takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil, and sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his father's office.  "

He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the dial, and removes a small notebook.  He takes it back to the desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger. We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA BRASI.  SONNY dials the number.  There is no answer.  "

S"NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945) The interior of an abandoned building.  SEVERAL MEN in suits and ties sit around in the booths.  HAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.  HAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette in his mouth.  ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye to the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered china cup.  HAGEN sips gratefully.  HAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes. SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.  HAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.  SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.  He leans close to HAGEN.  He opens the door; they step out together.  "

S"NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945) MICHAEL driving during the night.  There is a little fog in the air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making it difficult to see well.  The wipers move across the view, as the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still decorated for Christmas.  The courtyard is bathed with white floodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look.  The narrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link chain.  There are strange cars parked along the curving cement walk.  SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and chain; ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.  ANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and then turns.  The FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out.  "

S"NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945) MICHAEL moves into the living room; there is a Christmas tree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls.  THERESA HAGEN is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a cigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water glass half filled with whiskey.  On the other side of the sofa sits CLEMENZA; his face is impassive, but he is sweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black with his saliva.  PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone on the other side of the room.  CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up at him.  MICHAEL nods his relief.  He moves to THERESA.  Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and trembles.  Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the room; everyone speaks in a whisper.  He leads her into his father's office without knocking.  "

He reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise, he kisses him on the cheek.  She understands, and leaves them alone.  MICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on trial for their lives.  MICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the situation.  Outside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief. Then open the door and rush out.  Everyone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped in a tight embrace with his WIFE.  "

S"NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945) SONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted, in shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep.  It is four in the morning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many snacks.  They can barely talk anymore.  HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.  CLEMENZA nods.  MICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the number once again.  He can hear the phone ringing on the other end but no one answers.  Then hangs up.   There is a timid knock on the door.  PAULIE GATTO looks in.  TESSIO gets up, leaves.  He closes the door.  MICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected.  He dials Luca Brasi's number once again.  The ring repeats, but no one answers.  TESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest in his hand.  He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped inside.  INT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)  LUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we remember him.  BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand. LUCA looks up at him.  Then SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately. LUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both clamp down as hard as they can.  Suddenly, a garrote is thrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight.  His face begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a far more extreme way than a normal tongue could.  His eyes bulge.  ONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's strength leaves him.  SOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his face.  LUCA falls to the floor.  ----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------  FADE IN:  "

S"DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945) Morning in a simple Brooklyn suburb.  There are rows of pleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block.  A dark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a noticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell.  This is ROCCO LAMPONE.  The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA, talks to him through the screen door, and then points to the side of the house.  ROCCO moves to the garage, which is specially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work washing a shiny brand new Lincoln.  LAMPONE admires the car.  He scrubs and polishes with great affection.  As he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it, unwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.  LAMPONE expertly puts the gun away.  GATTO's car pulls into the driveway, and he sounds the horn.  The two men walk to the car.  GATTO is driving, a bit nervous, like he doesn't know what is up.  LAMPONE gets in the rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of recognition.  He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting to chide PAULIE for being late.  PAULIE flinches a little when he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:  CLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.  PAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook he was on.  Also there's the money he can make by selling Sollozzo any secret location.  The car pulls out.  "

There is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel, LAMPONE in the rear seat.  CLEMENZA steps in.  The car pulls out.  By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and secure.  '

S"DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945) The car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway. Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.  The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds.  CLEMENZA steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.  He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting the ground.  We wait on this for a moment; and then there are two GUNSHOTS.  CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and turns, moving back to the car.  PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind him are shattered.  LAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few feet where there is another car.  They get in, and drive off.  ---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------  "

S'DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945) HIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL.  It is late afternoon.  Many strange cars are parked on the nearby streets.  We can see the group of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries with concealed weapons.  MICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.  He is bundled in a warm marine coat.  He looks at the strange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe.  They look back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the respect of his position.  He is like an exile Prince.  He wanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard.  A rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground equipment.  The basketball ring now half coming off.  This is where he was a child.  Then a shout.  CLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window.  MICHAEL hurries into the house.  '

He glances at the THUGS in the kitchen.  Tries to shield the phone.  MICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table.  He curls up in a corner, and in a quarter voice:   CLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all the button men stationed around the house.  SONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.  MICHAEL starts to leave.  "

S'NITE: DON\'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945) A taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with a neon sign "HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY."  MICHAEL steps out, pays the fare...and then stops dead in his tracks.  MICHAEL looks.  He sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted.  He is the only one on the street.  There are gay, twinkling Christmas decorations all over the building.  He walks, slowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps.  He hesitates, looks around.  This area is empty.  He checks the address on a scrap of paper.  It is correct.  He tries the door, it is empty.  He walks in.  '

S'NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945) MICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital lobby.  He looks to the right; there is a long, empty corridor.  To the left: the same.  HIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated building lit by eerie green neon lighting.  All we hear are his sole footsteps.  He walks up to a desk marked "INFORMATION".  No one is there. He moves quickly to a door marked "OFFICE"; swings into it; no one is there.  He looks onto the desk:  There is half a sandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.  Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly, alertly.  MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all alone.  The floors have just been mopped.  They are still wet.  '

Now he hurries, trying to follow the code of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker and quicker they flash by him.  Now he stops, looks up "4A-- Corleone".  There is a special card table set up there with some magazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the ashtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.  '

S"NITE: DON'S ROOM 4A Slowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he will find.  He looks.  Lit by the moonlight through the window, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the room, and under a transparent oxygen tent.  All that can be heard is the steady though strained breathing.  Slowly MICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER, securely asleep.  Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the bed, and run to his nose and mouth.  This startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around.  It is a NURSE lit from the light behind her in the hallway.  MICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.  Quickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.  He hangs up; returns to the NURSE...  She does so...and they perform the very difficult task of moving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.  "

They push it into the first available room.  MICHAEL peeks out from the door.  The footsteps are louder; then they emerge.  It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet of flowers.  A look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.  MICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get.  "

S"NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945) Outside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO, pacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only weapon.  MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him.  They both stand under a lamppost in the cold December night. They are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette, lights it.  ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not.  The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas decorations.  We HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming.  MICHAEL and ENZO look with fear in their eyes.  Then MICHAEL takes the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket. They stand, hands in their pockets.  A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them. MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive.  The car seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates. MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved.  MICHAEL looks down; the BAKER's hands are shaking.  He looks at his own, and they are not.  Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of police sirens.  They are clearly coming toward the hospital, getting louder and louder.  MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.  In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed POLICE and DETECTIVES.  He smiles his relief and starts toward them.  TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his arms while ANOTHER frisks him.  A massive POLICE CAPTAIN, spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat, with beefy red face and white hair seems furious.  This is McCLUSKEY.  ANOTHER COP standing nearby:  MICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.  MICHAEL stands quiet.  Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength. MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw.  He looks at McCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and he falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S MEN arrive.  ---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------  "

There are more BUTTON MEN stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN standing by open windows.  It is clear that the war is escalating.  A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE, MICHAEL and HAGEN.  MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged.  He stops and looks up at the open window.  We can see MEN holding rifles.  They continue walking.  TESSIO joins them.  The various BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.  "

S'NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945) A very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor. SOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small round table near the center of the room.  There are empty booths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS, and ONE or TWO WAITERS.  It is very quiet.  The solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table. They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three glasses.  Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:  SOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian.  MICHAEL listening carefully and nodding every so often.  Then MICHAEL answers in Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on.  The WAITER occasionally brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on. Then MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in Italian, accidentally lapses into English.  MICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling holding his open hands up as if to say: "I have no tricks up my sleeve".  Then he looks away and makes a distressed look on his face.  SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious.  He studies MICHAEL with his dark eyes.  Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL\'s thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.  He looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them; indicating the bathroom with his eyes.  The MAN nods, indicating no one is there.  MICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and disappears inside.  '

S'NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945) MICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very hard.  He actually uses the urinal.  Then he washes his hands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly. Then he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet. Slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he cannot feel the gun.  We see behind the tank his hand is just a few inches from the gun...he gropes searchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.  CLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him.  Then he breaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep breath and shoves it under his waistband.  For some unexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately washes his hands and dries them.  Then he goes out.  '

S"NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945) He hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table. McCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal.  SOLLOZZO turns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at MICHAEL.  MICHAEL looks back.  Then he smiles and continues back to the table.  He sits down.  The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now he too relaxes.  SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton his jacket.  SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again but MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear him.  The WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts the gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his temple.  He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the entire area.  The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is sprayed and stained with blood.  SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he seems to hang in space suspended.  MICHAEL pivots, and looks:  There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal suspended in air before his gaping mouth.  MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging throat.  He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound.  Then coolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.  The air is filled with pink mist. MICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall. He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed. Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty. The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an expression of horror on his face. MICHAEL looks at his two victims: SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by the table. McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table. MICHAEL is wildly at a peak.  He starts to move out.  His hand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN. He moves, not letting the gun go.  MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.  His hand: still holding the gun.  His face: finally he closes his eyes.  His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.  He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.  He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had been recreated in wax.  Then he leaves.  ---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------  FADE IN:  "

ROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered with a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out.  A large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily.

S"DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46) Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York apartment building.  We recognize a couple of SONNY's bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards against the curb.  Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.  Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step, smoking a cigarette.  One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch, which is attached to a key chain.  We HEAR the sound of a door opening; they look up.  The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.  SONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI wrapped around him.  She doesn't want to let go of him; she draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he comes out alone, adjusting his clothes.  He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car.  The men quickly take up their positions.  As he gets in his car:  The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the bodyguards in their cars.  "

SONNY enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her back to him.  He turns her around in his arms.  Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time. As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red with rage.  She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing him from running out of the apartment.  Sonny listens, and calms himself.  He touches her shoulder, the thin silk robe.  He starts to leave.  He stops, and then laughs good naturedly.  She laughs with him.  He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.  "

S'DAY: CONNIE\'S STREET CARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St. "Book" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the corner.  The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the kids on the street are still playing stickball.  CARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block and to a halt in front of the candy store.  The tires scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a MAN comes hurtling out of the driver\'s seat, moving so fast the everyone is paralyzed.  It is a moment before we recognize that it is SONNY.  His face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on the stoop and has CARLO by the throat.  He pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down into the street.  But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing, and hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders. His shirt is ripped away in SONNY\'s hand.  SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.  SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength, in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing.  His blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.  The kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching in fascination.  CARLO\'s hands are clenched tight around the railing.  SONNY beats him mercilessly.  Now SONNY\'s bodyguards\' car pulls up, and they too become spectators.  SONNY\'s tight fists are going down like hammers, into CARLO\'s face and body.  CARLO\'s nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does nothing, other than hang onto the railing.  SONNY grabs hold of CARLO\'s massive body, and tries to drag him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in the effort.  Then he tries loosening CARLO\'s locked hands; even biting them.  CARLO screams but he does not let go.  It\'s clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will not be moved.  SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him more; but he is exhausted.  Totally out of breath, he stammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.  He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly. and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone, leaving even his bodyguards in confusion.  We notice ONE MAN with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially interested.  CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands.  He slumps onto the stoop.  ---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------  FADE IN:  '

S'DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946) HIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall.  It is a gray, rainy day. Young BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of various points around the main house and compound.  Things have changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new and secure gate house has been built.  Security measures that had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made a permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval Fortress.  We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the result of a recent bomb attempt.  The house nearest the crater is damaged by fire.  A taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the shelter of the gate house.  They are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they call the main house.  KAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still runs down onto her face.  She notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the sullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.  TOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.  KAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with rainwater.  TOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has to.  They hurry through the rain and into the Main House.  '

We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.  KAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.  KAY shakes her head.  HAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves toward MAMA, the letter extended.  She takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.  She looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what that means.  "

The DON does not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and glances, as clearly as if they were verbalized.  HAGEN is the spokesman for the family.  The OLD MAN glances at SONNY.  The OLD MAN nods.  The DON nods approvingly.  Then he searches around the room for a face he does not see.  HAGEN knows who he's looking for.  The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and rage.  The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they leave him alone.  INT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946)  HAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is expansive and optimistic.  "

S"DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946) CONNIE and CARLO's apartment.  She's in a slip, on the phone. We HEAR the shower going in the bathroom.  CONNIE's face turns red.   She slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the bathroom drying his golden body.  She hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then she flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy belly heaving under the thin slip.  He pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue dressing.  That calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and starts her wifely duties.  CARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in the doorway.  She turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen.  A moment later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking.  CARLO slowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically smashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy veal and peppers all over the apartment floor.  She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again.  Slowly, he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in his hand.  He swings the belt against her heavy hips.  She moves back into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it ready.  He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her.  She makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids.  He pulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process.  She gets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table, gets her; and starts to slap her in the face.  She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.  "

S"DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM  (SPRING 1946) She runs into the bedroom; he follows.  She moves into a corner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide under the bed.  He reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.  He slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he throws her on the bed, contemptuously.  He grabs part of her thigh, pinching it very hard.  Then he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving her in tears.  She is crying; she pulls herself to the bedroom phone, and in a whisper:  We can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.  "

S"NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT The serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone.  BONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes. BONASERA's lips are suddenly dry.  Silence.  BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright.   BONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE sees his pale expression, and follows him into the room.  Silently, he begins the ritual of dressing.  His WIFE knows something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes from him.  He lights a cigarette.  He slips into his trousers.  Then he moves to his WIFE to tie his tie, as she has done for years.  "

The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.  He draws down the gray blanket.

A car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the booth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets him, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll booths on both side of him, and from the front window of the car blocking him.  The windows of his car are shot out.  Bullet holes puncture the doors of his car.  His hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car.  His arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it continues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that he will survive it.  Suddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER fire.  His face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground.  A FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and make off in the distance.  SONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they are too late.  "

S"NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946) HAGEN alone in the office.  He is drinking.  He looks up at the sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving.  Then he hears footsteps.  The door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE slowly enters the room.  He walks directly to his stuffed armchair, sits down.  His face is stern, as he looks into HAGEN's eyes.  HAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.  Pause.  DON CORLEONE blinks.  One feels that just for a second he loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.  He rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...  And leaves.  HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...  "

S"Don Corleone is too modest.  He had the judges and politicians in his pocket and he refused to share them. His refusal is not the act of a friend.  He takes the bread out of the mouths of our families.  Times have changed, it's not like the old days where everyone can go his own way.  If Don Corleone had all the judges and politicians in New York, then he must share them or let others use them.  Certainly he can present a bill for such services, we're not Communists, after all. But he has to let us draw water from the well.  It's that simple. "

S"My friends, I didn't refuse out of malice.  You all know me.  When have I ever refused an accommodation? But why, this time?  Because I think this drug business will destroy us in the years to come. It's not like whiskey or gambling or even women which most people want and is forbidden them by the pezzonovante of the Church and the Government.  But drugs?  No.  Even policemen, who help us in gambling and other things would refuse to help us in drugs.  But...I am willing to do whatever all of you think is necessary. "

a(g4287
S'I don\'t believe in drugs.  For years I paid my people extra so they wouldn\'t do that kind of business...$200 a week.  But it didn\'t matter.  Somebody comes to them and says, "I have powders, if you put up three, four thousand dollar investment, we can make fifty thousand distributing."  Who can resist such a profit? There\'s no way to control it, as a business...to keep it respectable. (rapping the table) I don\'t want it near schools!  I don\'t want it sold to children. That is an infamita. (thinking) In my city I would try to keep the traffic in the dark people, the colored.  They are the best customers, the least troublesome, and they are animals anyway.  They have no respect for their wives or their families or themselves.  Let them lose their souls with drugs. But something has to be done, we can\'t have everybody running around doing just what they please, like a bunch of anarchists. '

S"I forego my vengeance for my dead son, for the common good.  But I have selfish reasons.  My youngest son had to flee, accused of Sollozzo's murder, and I must now make arrangements so that he can come home with safety, cleared of all those false charges.  That is my affair, and I will make those arrangements. (with strength) But I am a superstitious man...and so if some unlucky accident should befall my youngest son, if some police officer should accidentally shoot him, or if he should hang himself in his cell, or if my son is struck by a bolt of lightning, then I will blame some of the people here.  That, I could never forgive, but...aside from that, let me swear by the souls of my Grandchildren that I will never be the one to break the peace we have made. "

S"DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946) The Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.  CARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man, sits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a MAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and settles on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man; as the view continues, around the table, we HEAR:  The VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both younger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA, short and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the table to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his JEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an older man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO CUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then DON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair and a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his early sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at CONNIE's Wedding.  The VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks.  A large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times, and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during the day's trading, and projected above.  DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.  DON CORLEONE nods.  They all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that DON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something else in mind.  Slowly the DON rises.  "

GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea jacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets.  THE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on either side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his shoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable, and with a pleasing build.  Each of the SHEPHERDS  carry knapsacks.  The THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape, overlooking an impressive view of land and sea.  '

S'DAY: SICILY ROAD The THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make their way to a dusty rural road.  We HEAR a rinky horn sound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them. An OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL.  The car pulls in front of them and stops.  MICHAEL nods respectfully.  DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.  The OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.  The old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues on his journey.  '

They move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain. MICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water. They go on.  They move up a very narrow old street.  MICHAEL looks at the doorways that they pass.  MOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.  CALO sees MICHAEL looking.  MICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street.  He looks.  The street is empty, barren.  Occasionally, an old woman will pass.  MICHAEL turns his head.  The other side of the street: empty and deathly.

S'DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE A green ribboned field of a baronial Estate.  Further ahead is a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been discovered in the ruins of Pompeii.  There is a group of young village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS, dressed in black.  They have been gathering the pink sulla, purple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon blossoms.  They are singing, off in the distance as they work.  MICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this Fantasy-like scene.  He settles down to watch.  The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that cling to their bodies.  They are still in their teens, but developed and womanly.  They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove. Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them playfully, in the direction of the grove.  The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws them back at her pursuers laughing.  They come closer and closer.  Just short of the grove, she poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the view of the THREE MEN.  She stands there on her toes about to run.  MICHAEL sees her; now face to face.  He looks.  Her face.  Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair and a rich mouth.  Quickly, she turns, and runs away.  MICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her.  We hold on him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS laughing.  Then he turns to them.  CALO pats him on the shoulder.  '

S"DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE The little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate, is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.  MICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central square, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.  The proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man; he greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at their table.  VITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with new interest.  VITELLI does not laugh quite so much.  VITELLI is no longer drinking with them.  As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less, until he wears a scowl.  Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.  He goes into the back room after the innkeeper.  Then he returns.  They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.  MICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.  The two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in a moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI between them.  CALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.  CALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then asks:  -------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------  "

CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday best, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their luparas on their shoulders.  DON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off, rocky and bouncing on the dirt road.  The Sunday churchbells ring.   '

S'DAY: VITELLI HOUSE MICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by the yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the MOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS. Finally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate Sunday clothing.  Now he presents the wrapped gift to APPOLONIA.  She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives her permission to open it.  She unwraps it.  Her eyes light at the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace.  She looks at him.   '

As the VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and a half dozen AUNTS are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces further behind are CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas on their shoulders.  Further up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone, and falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm.  She modestly regains her balance, and they continue walking.  Behind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.   "

S'DAY: VITELLI VILLAGE CHURCH Church bells in an ancient belfry ring out.  Music, old and dissonant, plays.  There is a bridal procession in the street of the village; the same in feeling and texture as it might have been five hundred years ago.  Donkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant flowers; children carrying candles and wearing white confirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by countless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police.  We present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with all the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in Sicily.  APPOLONIA is radiant as the Bride; MICHAEL is handsome despite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.   '

He moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her, looking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body.  Slowly and tenderly he kisses her.  Her tiny hands come up to his face; touch his cheek and embrace him.  She lets her bridal slip fall to the floor.  --------------------------------------FADE OUT----------  "

S"DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD HIGH ANGLE ON DON TOMMASSINO'S VILLA  We HEAR girlish laughter; the little Alpha is driving erratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost hitting th inner court wall.  APPOLONIA is laughing, driving.  MICHAEL pretends to be frightened, as he teaches her to drive.  Outside the walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking guard duty.  The car stops and a laughing MICHAEL gets out.  DON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard.  He seems tired and concerned.  APPOLONIA kisses him.  For a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the Five Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.  "

S"DAY: VILLA COURTYARD There is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's seat, playing with the wheel like a child.  CALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear seat.  Then MICHAEL seems disturbed.  Over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO disappear through the gate.  MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.  MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.  APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay where he is.  He smiles affectionately.  CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling by his side.  There is no sight of FABRIZZIO.  Suddenly the smile fades from MICHAEL's face.  He steps forward and holds out his hand.  His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION, as she switched on the ignition.  Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off; and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.  MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.  "

S"DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951) Easter.  A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime.  Hordes of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets, searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden Easter eggs.  The DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.  Suddenly, he stops and looks.  MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.  Great emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in MICHAEL's direction.  MICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son and embraces him.  "

There is knock on the door.  NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL, who nods.  NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters, followed by TWO BODYGUARDS.  He is a handsome hood, dressed in the Hollywood style.  His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast style.  MOE laughs.  GREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense.  NERI eyes the BODYGUARDS.  MICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal:  Nobody answers.  MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door. MOE exits angrily.  "

S"DAY: N.Y. AIRPORT (1955) KAY sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark AIRPORT.  ROCCO LAMPONE is leaning against it.  She has a little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who plays with a cardboard bird on a string.  Two other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have learned to tell are bodyguards.  MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO PORTERS carrying luggage.  NERI sees something, and taps MICHAEL on the shoulder.  MICHAEL turns, and sees KAY.  LAMPONE opens the car door; KAY steps out with the BOY, and MICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son.  Automatically, the luggage is put in.  NERI replaces LAMPONE as the driver; and LAMPONE joins the other men.  HAGEN gets into one of the other cars.  And the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other sedans.  "

MICHAEL nods to NERI; who gives them their privacy a moment longer.  NERI opens the door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too.  He smiles at her, tired, and a little sad.  She smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY and the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's.  "

S"DAY: DON'S OFFICE (1955) VIEW ON DON CORLEONE, much older, much smaller in size.  He wears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt.  He sits in a chair, gazing out through the window, into the garden.  The OLD MAN looks up.  CLEMENZA stand before him in the Den. Beside him is an anxious TESSIO.  NERI stands by the door; HAGEN is seated; MICHAEL sits behind the big desk.  Everyone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction. He remains inexpressive.  There are uneasy looks all around.  He looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN.  They all nod, reluctantly.  NERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door.  CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave, then CARLO.  NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.  Then NERI closes the door.  MICHAEL relaxes.  TOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence.  TOM leaves.  MICHAEL looks at NERI.  NERI nods, and then leaves.  The DON opens the doors, breathes in the air, and steps outside.  "

Then stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.  He rises, and looks at Michael...  The DON walks on further.  MICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then:  A long silence.  The DON smiles at MICHAEL.  "

Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally the Altar.  MAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles.  There is a large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting candles.  MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives her some.  MAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights twenty candles.  She finishes, and bows her head.  '

An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous. Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King.  Each car carries an elaborate floral decoration.  We show these in detail; and the flowered messages: "A Benefactor to Mankind", "He Knew and Pitied"..."Our Don Our Leader"..."The Sacred Heart"...  '

S"DAY: MALL (1955) HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL  Silence.  The flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill all the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.  Hundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is somber and respectful.  MICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform which holds the ornate coffin.  We cannot see the remains of Don Corleone.  BONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved family.  One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely with grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.  The VIEW ALTERS,  and we see that the line is endless.  JOHNNY FONTANE, tears openly falling, takes his turn.  Children are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last look at the great man.  CLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE.  LAMPONE immediately arranges for the members of the Five New York Families to pay their respects.  First CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI.  Then PHILIP TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.  Then BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.  MICHAEL watches the scene.  BARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined by his men.  As BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that he is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don Corleone.  MICHAEL watches silently.  BARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes.  First CLEMENZA.  Then TESSIO.  CONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes.  He embraces and comforts her.  Everywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching all who come close to him.  "

TESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown', and they move though the crowd, looking for Michael.  He finds him.  MIKE; nods; and they move to a private place.  NERI is close by.  MICHAEL looks at him.  "

S'DAY: CEMETERY (1955) The Cemetery.  Late day.  The hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the stone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in Queens Village.  Hundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take pictures, etc.  MICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN.  HAGEN looks at him; understands.  They look up.  The coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which stands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel, with the bold inscription: CORLEONE.  ---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------  FADE IN:  '

He opens it, and we see in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's uniform.  He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently. Then the badge, and the identification card; with his picture on it.  Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he begins to dress.  "

S'DAY: FIFTH AVE. NERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area.  He continues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center.  On his side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly across from the main entrance of the building.  Slowly he approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his nightstick.  The DRIVER looks up in surprise.  NERI points to the "No Parking" sign.  The DRIVER turns his head away.  The DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately, and hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI\'s jacket.  NERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street.  Then he crooks a finger at the DRIVER.  '

Everyone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.  As the fuss is going on, a car pulls up.  LAMPONE gets out and works his way to MICHAEL.  He whispers in his ear.  This is the news MICHAEL has been waiting for.  CONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.  The infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an excuse to back away.  He kisses KAY.  People are guided to the correct limousines; they start to drive off.  '

S'DAY: MALL (1955) The TWO MEN walk out onto the Mall, toward a car.  On their way they are stopped by TWO BODYGUARDS.  THREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.  He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he panics, and then he accepts it.  TESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses.  HAGEN turns, and walks away from the group.  Then about twenty paces away, he stops, and looks back.  TESSIO is led into a waiting car.  HAGEN looks away, and walks off.  '

He wears a broad smile.  The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and backs into the living room.  "

S"DAY: MALL CARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his things in the trunk.  ONE opens the front door for him.  SOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who.  CARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back to see the other man.  It is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.  The motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA suddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck.  He chokes and leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.  The garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.  His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.  Then the body goes slack.  CLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car drives off.  "

S"DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955) Inside the Corleone house.  Big boxes have been packed; furniture prepared for shipping.  She hurries into the living room, where she comes upon MICHAEL and KAY.  But CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL.  NERI is watchful.  TWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders from him.  But he stands there, waiting for his sister to finish.  She tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria she has no saliva.  The TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her, gently but firmly.  KAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from MICHAEL.  He feels her look.  But KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.  She looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so directly that we know he will tell the truth.  KAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs him.  Then she kisses him.  "

From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the drinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the house with their BODYGUARDS.  She watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive them.  He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one foot slightly behind the other.  One hand on his hip, like a Roman Emperor.  The CAPOREGIMES stand before him.  CLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it.  The smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her husband has become.  "
